## Starting server from kubernetes

This project needs ingress to expose backend service outside. To install ingress, run the following

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.7.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml`

To learn more about ingress installation, you can refer [here](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy)

To start the server, go to `server/` and run `make build` to build the docker image. After building, run `make deploy`. Then, the backend service will be available at `http://localhost/backend/`

## Running unit tests

1. `pip install pytest pytest-coverage`
2. `cd server`
